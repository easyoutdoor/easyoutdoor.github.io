Easter is coming. National holidays always mean hikes to us. Mountains is always a good option to us, but it’s spring and there is lots of snow in the north. The weather forecast shows high possibility of rain in the south during this period. So we abandoned our first choice - southern Spain and chose to hike in the Netherlands which have potentially good weather.

As my boyfriend lives in the Netherlands, the Netherlands have become an easy destination for our hikes. But it’s not so preferred by us. Because it’s flat (it’s so flat that each time during our hikes when we found a land with a bump, we shout out ‘mountain’ and climbed on it).  Nevertheless, we have also done many very interesting hike in the Netherlands. The Netherlands has it’s special landscapes, like dunes and canals, and it’s also a country of flowers and a paradise for birds. 

We decided to see the national flowers of the Netherlands - the  tulips. Perhaps you have heard of the Keukenhof garden in the Netherlands. I visited the Keukenhof years ago and I don’t suggest you going there unless you want to see more people instead of flowers, the same state as the Monet garden in France. 

We prefer to see flowers without much “ human interference ”. And my boyfriend found this map of distribution of tulips fields on the web: https://tulipsinholland.com/flower-areas/. Excellent. we could do a flower trip in those dark zone like the lavender hike we have done in 2018 in the south of France.

As the flower zone is quite large, we tried our first time biking together. The Netherlands is also a country of bikes. The public transport company NS also provides bike renting service for the locals for a very low price. If you have an address that has your name on, you can apply for this 40% off transport card, and with this card, you can rent two bikes at a time.

To be honest I did underestimate the difficulty of biking and overestimate my ability to bike. The bloody fact that I proofed the following day is that if you haven’t been biking for years, don’t plan an ambitious biking journey unless you want yourself injured and completely destroyed... As you may see from this photo, this bike is not equipped with hand breaks and it’s heavy.. I fell with my bike 30 minutes after biking because I went off track... Luckily I didn’t went into the canal and only bruised my arms and my knees. I continued of course.

10 minutes after falling I saw this. My feelings were quite complex. And then more flower fields of course. The weather was very good, which made the color more vivid.

I might forget my pain at some point. We stopped at this place for a brief lunch.
