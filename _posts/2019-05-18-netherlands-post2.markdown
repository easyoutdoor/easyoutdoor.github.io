Easter is coming. National holidays always mean hikes to us. Mountains is always a good option to us, but it’s spring and there is lots of snow in the north. The weather forecast shows high possibility of rain in the south during this period. So we abandoned our first choice - southern Spain and chose to hike in the Netherlands which have potentially good weather.

As my boyfriend lives in the Netherlands, the Netherlands have become an easy destination for our hikes. But it’s not so preferred by us. Because it’s flat (it’s so flat that each time during our hikes when we found a land with a bump, we shout out ‘mountain’ and climbed on it).  Nevertheless, we have also done many very interesting hike in the Netherlands. The Netherlands has it’s special landscapes, like dunes and canals, and it’s also a country of flowers and a paradise for birds. 

We decided to see the national flowers of the Netherlands - the  tulips. Perhaps you have heard of the Keukenhof garden in the Netherlands. I visited the Keukenhof years ago and I don’t suggest you going there unless you want to see more people instead of flowers, the same state as the Monet garden in France. 

We prefer to see flowers without much “ human interference ”. And my boyfriend found this map of distribution of tulips fields on the web: https://tulipsinholland.com/flower-areas/. Excellent. we could do a flower trip in those dark zone like the lavender hike we have done in 2018 in the south of France.

As the flower zone is quite large, we tried our first time biking together. The Netherlands is also a country of bikes. The public transport company NS also provides bike renting service for the locals for a very low price. If you have an address that has your name on, you can apply for this 40% off transport card, and with this card, you can rent two bikes at a time.

To be honest I did underestimate the difficulty of biking and overestimate my ability to bike. The bloody fact that I proofed the following day is that if you haven’t been biking for years, don’t plan an ambitious biking journey unless you want yourself injured and completely destroyed... As you may see from this photo, this bike is not equipped with hand breaks and it’s heavy.. I fell with my bike 30 minutes after biking because I went off track... Luckily I didn’t went into the canal and only bruised my arms and my knees. I continued of course.

10 minutes after falling I saw this. My feelings were quite complex. And then more flower fields of course. The weather was very good, which made the color more vivid.

I might forget my pain at some point. We stopped at this place for a brief lunch.

Then we continued to our helicopter!

Yes, this is our accommodation.  We slept in this UK made helicopter during the night and the following day we arrived at London. That’s kidding. This place is a camping ground called  Camping Land from Sea. A crazy place with accommodations in the bus, in tree house, in tram... and of course in this helicopter.  Usually people booked this and arrived by car but the camping ground lady told us that we are the first ones that arrived by bike.

Our guest: the camping cat. A very friendly cat. Camping cat is actually it’s name. It refused to leave the helicopter and stuck on that sun warmed chair. It’s really comfortable, isn’t it.

After using any effort to throw the camping cat out of the helicopter, we eventually locked our helicopter and were able to get start to go to our last destination of the day - the  Afsluitdijk dam. 

Month ago when I was searching for the possible destinations in the Netherlands,  I noticed this photo:

It’s a satellite image of Afsluitdijk dam. It’s 32kms long, located in the northern Netherlands, a  magnificent human construction to separate the southern sea from the northern sea, to conserve light water and to create polder land. 

I was fascinated by this astonishing colorful landscape and decided to get there anyhow. We arrived at the dam by bike around 5pm.

Honestly, comparing to the feeling when I saw the satellite image, I’m quite disappointed after we actually reached this dam. Mostly because that we couldn’t get on the dam because it had it’s building works on and all the access were blocked. And of course also because that after 4 hours biking against the wind, I was exhausted. I once planned to have a bike tour from the camping ground, through the 32 km dam and bike back to the camping ground. This appears to me just a stupid idea ever after I arrived the dam with my destroyed body. 

After a brief stop, we decided to bike back to our helicopter. 

The way from the camping ground to the dam:
