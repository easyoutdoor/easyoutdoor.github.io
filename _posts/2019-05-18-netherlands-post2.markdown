<h3 style="color:black;text-align:center">Two days of biking and a small hike in North Holland</h3>
<h4 style="text-align:center">(in detail)</h4>

Easter was coming. National holidays always means hikes to us. Mountains is always a nice option, but it was spring and there was lots of snow in the mountains. We were considering of flying to the South of Spain but the weather forecast was showing a high possibility of rain in this region. So we abandoned our first choice -- southern Spain and chose to hike in the Netherlands which had potentially good weather.

As my boyfriend lives in the Netherlands, it has become an easy destination for our hikes. But it’s not an optimal destination, because it’s flat (it’s so flat that each time during our hikes when we found a land with a bump, we shouted out ‘mountain’ and climbed on it).  Nevertheless, we have also done many very interesting hike in the Netherlands. The Netherlands has it’s special landscapes, like dunes and canals, and it’s also a country of flowers and a paradise for birds. 

We decided to see the national flowers of the Netherlands -- the  tulips. Perhaps you have heard of the Keukenhof garden in the Netherlands. I visited the Keukenhof years ago and I don’t suggest that you go there unless you want to see more people instead of flowers.

We preferred to see flowers, avoiding the crowds. My boyfriend found this [map of distribution of tulips][tulip-address] fields on the web. Excellent; we could do a flower trip in those dark zones, similar to the lavender hike we did in 2018 in the south of France.

As the flower zone is quite large, we decided to try to do a biking trip for the first time together. The Netherlands is also a country of bikes. The public transport company NS provides bike renting service for the locals for a very low price. If you have an address in the Netherlands, you can order a transport card, and with this card, you can rent up to two bikes at the same time.

To be honest I did underestimate the difficulty of biking and I did overestimate my ability to bike. The lesson that I learned the following day was: if you haven’t been biking for years, don’t plan an ambitious biking journey unless you want yourself injured and completely destroyed... As you may see from the photo above, these bikes are not equipped with hand breaks and they are heavy... I fell with my bike 30 minutes after biking because I went off track... Luckily I didn’t fall into the canal and only got bruises in my arms and my knees. I continued biking of course.

10 minutes after falling with the bike I saw this. My feelings were quite complex. And after this more flower fields of course. The weather was very good, which made the colors more vivid.

I might have forgotten my pain at some point. We stopped at this place for a brief lunch:

</a>

Then we continued to our helicopter!

<a class="image-link" href="//easyoutdoor.github.io/assets/images/post_2_netherland_biking/helicopter.png" data-lightbox="day-1-image" data-title="helicopter">
  <img class="large-image" src="/assets/images/post_2_netherland_biking/helicopter.png" title="helicopter">
</a>

Yes, this was our accommodation. We slept in this British helicopter during the night and the following day we arrived at London (kidding). This was on the camping ground called ‘Camping Land from Sea’. A crazy place where you could sleep in the bus, in a tree house, in a tram... and of course in this helicopter. We were told that usually people who booked accommodation arrived by car and that we were the first that arrived by bike.

When we were searching for accommodation for this trip and comparing the prices of different hotels, we found this camping ground by accident. To our surprise, the price of one night in this helicopter was about 100 euros for 2 people, lower than the average price of one night’s hotel in this region. There was everything you needed to spend the night in the helicopter : blankets, pillows, sheet, radiator and you also had a table, two chairs and some kitchen kits at the entrance to the helicopter. The only inconvenience was that the public restroom and the bathroom were a little bit far from it.

<a class="image-link" href="//easyoutdoor.github.io/assets/images/post_2_netherland_biking/cat_in_helicopter.png" data-lightbox="day-1-image" data-title="guest">
  <img class="medium-image" src="/assets/images/post_2_netherland_biking/cat_in_helicopter.png" title="guest">
</a>

Our guest: the camping cat. A very friendly cat. Camping cat is actually it’s name. It refused to leave the helicopter and the chair warmed up by the sun. It was really comfortable, wasn’t it?

After many failed efforts we managed to throw the camping cat out of the helicopter. Then we eventually locked our helicopter and were able to start the trip to our last destination of the day -- the  Afsluitdijk dam. 

About one month before the trip when I was searching for the possible destinations in the Netherlands,  I noticed this photo: 

<a class="image-link" href="//easyoutdoor.github.io/assets/images/post_2_netherland_biking/dam_satelite.png" data-lightbox="day-1-image" data-title="the dam">
  <img class="large-image" src="/assets/images/post_2_netherland_biking/dam_satelite.png" title="the dam">
</a>

It’s a satellite image of Afsluitdijk dam. It’s 32kms long, located in the northern Netherlands, a  magnificent human construction to separate the sea from the river delta area.

I was fascinated by this astonishing colorful landscape and decided to go there. And indeed we arrived at the dam by bike around 5pm that day. 

<a class="image-link" href="//easyoutdoor.github.io/assets/images/post_2_netherland_biking/dam1.png" data-lightbox="day-1-image" data-title="the dam">

  <img class="medium-image" src="/assets/images/post_2_netherland_biking/dam2.png" title="the dam">
</a>

Honestly, comparing to the feeling when I saw the satellite image, I’m quite disappointed after we actually reached this dam. Mostly because that we couldn’t get on the dam because due to construction works the access was blocked. And of course also because that after 4 hours biking against the wind, I was exhausted. Before the trip I was planning to do a bike tour from the camping ground over the 32 km long dam and back to the camping ground. This appeared to me like the stupidest idea ever after I arrived at the dam with my destroyed body. 

The western end of the dam had a big fishing harbor. There were many fishing boats and lots of industrial fishing equipment. It was certainly not a busy moment when we arrived -- late in the afternoon on Easter Sunday. Most of the tourists had left already and a small restaurant for fish and chips was preparing to stop the service. Bad luck for us as we were hungry, and tired. It would have been better if we could have eaten in the restaurant and had a rest. 

After a brief stop and some snacks, we decided to bike back to our helicopter.

The way back the following day we were biking with a tailwind for which I was grateful. 

<a class="image-link" href="//easyoutdoor.github.io/assets/images/post_2_netherland_biking/pizza.png" data-lightbox="day-1-image" data-title="pizza">
  <img class="medium-image" src="/assets/images/post_2_netherland_biking/pizza.png" title="pizza">
</a>

We were told that we could buy sandwiches at the camping ground, but when we were back, it was sort of late and the sandwiches were no longer available. We ended up having a dinner at a local restaurant about 10 minutes on foot from the camping ground. Usually I have a bad appetite when I am tired and my friend is an opposite: he eats like a horse after hiking. Anyway, the pizzas were ok and large and we saved the rest of them for the breakfast on the next day.

It’s a bit narrow inside of the helicopter but there is enough space for a double mattress for 2 people. I was exhausted and fell asleep immediately. My legs were super sore cause of biking, and my muscles were protesting even more after having rested a whole night. That I had never experienced before because that based on my hiking experience in the past, the muscle pain usually disappeared after one night’s rest. 

As the weather forecast predicted, the second day was another sunny day. We took the leftover pizza and hot tea as breakfast, then after a quick packing, we started to head back to Schagen train station to return our bikes. If we want to pay only one day’s rental price, they need to be returned before noon. Fyi, the rental price of OV bikes is quite low within 24 hours. In case of a rental period over 24 hours (less than 2 days), they charge you more than twice the daily price. 

We took a different path and thanks to the tailwind, it took us less than 2 hours biking and we made to the train station before noon. Here is a nice tulip field on our way back:
