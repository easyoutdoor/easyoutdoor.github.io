Welcome to our blog Easy Outdoor.

This blog is made by me and my boyfriend. We are two hiking enthusiasts, we both like the nature, mountains, forests... everything opposite to the big cities and the crowds. But when you are living, working or studying in the cities, it’s sort of difficult to find lots of suitable time to prepare the real interesting hikes. You need at least 8 days to do Tour the Mont Blanc, two weeks to complete the famous GR20. No mention the Saint Jacques de Compostelle hikes, they take even month... (It’s true that I still have my summer vacation, ermm.. but I cannot wait to hike until summer...)

During the past 3 years, me and my boyfriend have done a lot of interesting hikes in various seasons. We use the weekends, or spend 3 or 4 days whenever we have the spare time to do hike on the mountains, to explore the gorges, to visit the monasteries, or to collect mushrooms (this is one of my favorite activities). We don’t have a car so we use only public transport to arrive to our destinations, and we lodged most of the time in the hotels, gites, and some of the time in camping grounds. 

The purpose of this blog is: First, to write down our hiking experiences -- to create a ‘hiking diary’. We will try to write down all interesting details occurred during our journey, to keep those beautiful memories for the future. Second, to share our hiking experiences with everyone. It’s possible to use small budget of money and time to do real hikes, to take a break from the daily routines in the big city and get yourself in the middle the magnificent mother nature. And also to appreciate the nature and learn to protect it. 

We will share with you our itineraries, our photos and our suggestions to help you prepare your next hike.  The hikes that we have done in the past three years are mostly in France, because I am actually living in France now and of course because France is a very very beautiful country with lots of different landscapes. We have also done some hikes in Crete, Germany, Monaco, Finland and Netherlands. If we have enough time, we can also develop our blog in some other languages, like en français, pourquoi pas? 

We will first try to add online little by little the hikes that we have done in the past and then update our blog as soon as when our next hike has been completed. (hmm what’s the next destination...) 

Have fun when you read it and if you find it’s useful, don’t forget to share our blog Easy Outdoor with your friends!
