Welcome to our blog Easy Outdoor. 

This blog is made by me and my boyfriend. We are two hiking enthusiasts, we both like the nature, mountains, forests... everything opposite of the big cities and the crowds. But when you are living, working or studying in the cities, it’s sort of difficult to find lots of suitable time to prepare the real interesting hikes. You need at least 8 days to do Tour the Mont Blanc, two weeks to complete the famous GR20. No mention the Saint Jacques de Compostelle hikes, they take even month.. (It’s true that I still have my summer vacation, ermm.. but I cannot wait to hike until summer..)

During the past 3 years, me and my boyfriend have done a lot of interesting hikes through the whole time of year. We use the weekends, 3 days, 4 days, whenever we have the spare time to do hike on the mountains, to explore the gorges, to visit the monasteries, or to collect mushrooms (this is one of my favorite activities). We don’t have a car so we use only the public transports to arrive to our destinations, and we lodged most of the time in the hotels, gites, and some of the time in the camping grounds. 

The purpose of creating this blog is first to write down our hiking experiences - to create a ‘ hiking diary ’. We will try to note down every interesting details occurred during our journey, to keep those beautiful memories for the future. And the second is to share our hiking experiences with everyone. It’s possible to use small budget of money and time to do real hikes, to get rid of yourself from the daily routines in the big city and get yourself in the middle the magnificent mother nature. To appreciate the nature and then learn to protect it. 

We will share with you our itineraries, our photos and our suggestions to help you prepare your next hike.  The hikes that we have done in the past three years are mostly in France. Because I am living in France now actually and of course la France is a very very beautiful country with lots of different landscapes. We have also done some hikes in Crete, Germany, Monaco, Finland and Netherlands. If we have enough time, we can also develop our blog in some other languages, like en français, pourquoi pas? 

We will first try to put online little by little the hikes that we have done in the past and then update our blog as soon as when our next hike is done. (hmm what’s the next destination...) 

Have fun when you read it and if you find it’s useful, don’t forget to share our blog Easy Outdoor with your friends!
